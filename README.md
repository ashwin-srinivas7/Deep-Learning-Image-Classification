# Deep Learning for Image classification

This project implements 2 widely used transfer learning techniques (feature extraction and fine-tuning) for classifying images into 5 possible categories.
The dataset contains 15k+ images from scientific publications that are hand-labeled as one of the five classes: equation, photo, scheme, table, and visualization. 


Part 1	- Feature Extraction using pre-trained ResNet50 architecture

Part 2	- Fine Tuning

We then evaluate both the transfer learning techniques by comparing their test accuracy to determine which model performed better.
Along the way, we also train each model for 10 epochs and record the weights and biases of model with the highest validation accuracy
